# **OpenPose-Fall-Detection**

Implementing fall detection using the OpenPose algorithm. Integrated with a voice alert system that alerts when a person falls.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time fall detection using the OpenPose algorithm.
- Voice alert system for immediate notifications.
- Ideal for environments where quick detection and response are critical.
